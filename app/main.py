PrivaTo-Do is a **TODO list** and **note-taking**. The main difference of this app is that the tasks are
stored in a [blockchain](https://builtin.com/blockchain) that creates a history with all the changes and modifications
of the different notes/tasks.
Check the Github repository [didacdev](https://github.com/didacdev).

## Tasks

* You can send request to the API to **add** or **mark as completed** any task.
* It is also possible to replace de present blockchain 
* Finally, you can just get the blockchain to read the task data
